# Programming Languages

Building a catalog of ressources around the differents programming languages. They all have their specificities and there is a lot of lost time finding them or not knowing them when trying to code in those languages.

This section has the goal to provide some shortcuts to shorten the frustration of being stuck trying to implement something that should be straightforward in the following languages:

- [C](./c.md)
- [C++](./c++.md)
- [C#](./cs.md)
- [JavaScript](./javascript/javascript.md)
	- [TypeScript](./javascript/typescript.md)
- [Rust](./rust.md)
